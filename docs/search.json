    "text": "Dissecting a Bad Visualization\nBelow is an example of a less-than-ideal visualization from the collection linked above. It comes to us from data provided for the Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report by the Gallup World Poll:\n\n\nWhile there are certainly issues with this image, do your best to tell the story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do you think the authors meant to convey with it?\n\nIt appears that this image is trying to represent the proportions of people in each country that answered affirmatively to the statement “Vaccines are safe”. That data come from the year 2018, and are grouped by global region. We can see that the median affirmative answer in each global region increases from the bottom of the plot to the top.\n\nList the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization. Hint: Variables refer to columns in the data.\n\nVariables include:\n\nPercentage of people who believe that vaccines are safe\nGlobal region\nRegion medians\nCountries\n\n\nNow that you’re versed in the grammar of graphics (e.g., ggplot), list the aesthetics used and which variables are mapped to each.\n\nThe aesthetics map to variables in the following ways:\n\nx is mapped to proportion of the population that believes that vaccines are safe\ny is mapped to…nothing?\ncolor is mapped to goblal region\nlabel is mapped individual country names\nEach point represents the proportion of a country’s pro-vacc’ers, and is drawn with geom_point()\n\nVertical lines are added using geom_vline() to show regional medians, which increase as one looks higher in the plot\n\n\nWhat type of graph would you call this? Meaning, what geom would you use to produce this plot?\n\nThis appears to be a scatterplot that also creates a quasi-faceting effect by grouping countries based on region, and then separating them vertically depending on the median proportion of belief in vaccine safety in each global region. I would use geom_point() to create this plot.\n\nProvide at least four problems or changes that would improve this graph. Please format your changes as bullet points!\n\nFour ways to improve this plot are:\n\nEliminate the legend\nDouble-code the points to further distinguish them beyond color\nEliminate the appearance of the y-axis in each facet representing something quantitative\nMake points clickable so that one can see percentages for individual countries\n[Bonus] I would add a search bar so that someone can search for individual countries"
